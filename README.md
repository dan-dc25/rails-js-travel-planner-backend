# README

Welcome to the Travel Planner App. This is a simple Single Page Application where users can plan their upcoming trips.

We have the ability to create trips, with destination and date. And then we are able to plan the activities for our trip. 

This application has two separate GitHub Directories with the main one being the back end with this ReadMe. 

You can find the Front End directory with all the JavaScript Code here -<https://github.com/dan-dc25/js-travel-planner-app/tree/master> 

Once you have your server running on the back ebd with the command -<rails s> you can then open the <index.html> page on the front end and begin using the app.
